Computer Science Paper Code
Dear reader,
I studied scalable duplicate detection using k-shingling, minhashing LSH and classification.
Product The dataset used is available from: https://personal.eur.nl/frasincar/datasets/TVs-all- merged.zip as a JSON file that contains 1,624 descriptions of televisions coming from four Web shops: Amazon.com, Newegg.com, Best-Buy.com, and TheNerds.net. This study is part of my Computer Science Assignment.

The files consists of the following:
